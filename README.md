# React Tutorial
Based on the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) as prescribed by [Pete Hunt's tutorial](https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto), which furthermore I found via this [crazy compendium](https://github.com/dexteryy/spellbook-of-modern-webdev#gui-framework) javascript resources.
